AXI4-Lite bridge to CANakari CAN-Controller
____________________________________________

This is an extension of the CANakari CAN-Controller by an AXI4-Lite interface on a Zedboard with Xilinx Zynq SoC block.
The interface has been created and used as IP.
The projekt-file instantiates the Verilog-files of the CANakari.
* [Verilog Implementation](../main/Verilog)

Attached is a pdf-file with a general instruction for creating an IP, 
which is based on the project and can be used as a guide.
Furthermore the tutorial contains a PetaLinux installation of a hardware design.
The manual is written in German.
