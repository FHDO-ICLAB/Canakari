AXI4-Lite bridge to CANakari CAN-Controller
____________________________________________

This is an extension of the CANakari CAN-Controller with an AXI4-Lite interface for integration in a Xilinx Zynq SoC.
The interface has been created and used as an IP with a Zedboard.
The project file instantiates the Verilog modules of the CANakari design.
* [Verilog Implementation](../main/Verilog)

Attached is a pdf file written in german with a general instruction for creating IPs with Vivado, which is based on the project and can be used as a guide.
Furthermore the tutorial contains a PetaLinux installation for use with a hardware design.
